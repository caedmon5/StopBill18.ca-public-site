                <h2 class="section-heading">Bill 18 gives the provincial government the power to prevent Albertans and Albertan organizations from applying for Federal grants and programmes</h2>
                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded"></p>
                <p class="text-faded">Alberta Bill 18, known as the Provincial Priorities Act, 2024, is a law that mandates provincial oversight and approval of any contractual or collaborative agreements between provincial entities and the federal government. This includes a broad range of institutions and bodies within the province, including universities and colleges, municipalities, heritage organisations, and so on. The law allows provincial politicians and bureaucrats to decide whether Albertans are allowed to accept money from Ottawa: the money they paid in taxes.</p>
<p>The bill was introduced as a part of a sweeping power-grab by the province, reaching into all corners of local governance and public organizations in the province, including Bill 20, which allows the provincial cabinet to remove city councillors and invalidate local bylaws; Bill 22, which gives cabinet complete control over regional health care; and Bill 18, which prevents Albertan organizations from competing on a level playing field with Canadians across the country in federal grant competitions.</p>
<p class="text-faded">The law represents a significant shift in how provincial and federal interactions are managed, potentially affecting the autonomy of institutions and individuals as they apply for federal funding or negotiate directly with the federal government. It was passed without any implementation plan &#x2014; or any real understanding of how Federal funding works. Among the problems with the law's design:
<ul><li>>b>It doesn't say whether applications should be vetted before Ottawa awards money or afterwards</b>. Since some programmes have success rates of 25% or less, vetting before means civil servants will have to read as many as three unsuccessful applications for every winner; if afterwards, it means that government politicians might end up requiring Albertans to return federal money (which comes from our tax dollars) to Ottawa)!</li>
<li><b>It doesn't exempt First Nations groups (who are under federal jurisdiction) when they collaborate with non-Indigenous institutions</b>. While a last minute amendment stopped the law from applying to First Nations when they are the applicants, collaborations with others will require provincial interference.</li>
<li><b>It misunderstands how federal grants are adjudicated</b>. Many federal programmes use peer review panels to determine the winners &#x2014; panels that almost always include (and are often led by) Albertans!</li>
<li><b>It restricts Albertan's competitiveness</b>. Albertans have a great track record in Ottawa of winning grants. By adding an extra layer of bureaucracy and possibly preventing some successful applications from Albertans from receiving federal funding, the law simply gives applicants from other provinces a leg up.</li>
</ul></p>
<p class="text-faded">While it appears that the Province may be considering offering exemptions for many types of funding requests from Post Secondary researchers and smaller institutions and cities, it plans to keep interfering in applications from our major cities and in institutional applications. This means that the government can use federal money for political ends: preventing Calgary and Edmonton from accepting money for transit projects, for example, in order to score points against the opposition.</p>
